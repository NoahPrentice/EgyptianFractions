# EgyptianFractions
An implementation of Fibonacci's algorithm for creating Egyptian fractions.

Given a regular fraction x/y, its Egyptian fraction representation is a sum of fractions whose denominator is 1 summing to x/y. For example, the Egyptian fraction representation of 2/3 is 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6. Fibonacci's algorithm for producing these is described in the following video by Michael Penn, which inspired the development of this program: https://youtu.be/vVEcqzjykHU.
